Tuples.


Tuples are ordered sets of values that store multiple data types. Tuples are immutable and are separated by commas. For instance, “(2.0, 3.4, 5.0)” is an example of a 3-tuple containing three numerical objects listed by commas inside the parenthesis.


Advantages of Tuples.


Immutable:  immutability ensures data integrity and prevents accidental changes.

Faster: Tuples are generally faster than lists because they have a smaller memory footprint and simpler internal structure.

Hashable: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable. This allows for efficient lookup and retrieval of data.

Safe: Since tuples are immutable, they can be used to store sensitive data that should not be modified.


Disadvantages of Tuples.


Limited Operations: Tuples have limited built-in operations compared to lists. For example, you cannot append, remove, or sort elements in a tuple.

Less Flexible: Tuples are less flexible than lists because they cannot be modified. If you need to change the elements, you have to create a new tuple.

Less Intuitive: Tuples can be less intuitive to work with, especially for beginners, due to their immutability and limited operations.


Properties of Tuples.


It can hold multiple values in a single variable.

It's ordered meaning that the item does not change.

A tuple can have duplicate values.

They are indexed you can access them numerically.

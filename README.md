Heaps.

Heaps  is a special  Tree based Structure in which which the tree is the complete  binary tree. The types of Heaps include max-Heaps and Min-Heaps.

Advantages of Heaps.

It healps in finding maximum and minimum elements.
They do not have any limit on memory storage.
Allows you to access variables globally.

Disadvantages of Heaps.

It Takes longer to compute.
Because it is used globally, memory management is more complicated.

Properties of Heaps.

It is complete binary tree.
Insertion and removal in heaps are efficient.
The minimum and the maximum element is always at the root of the heeap.

Aplications of Heaps.

Used in almost every 3D video to determine object needs to be renderd.
Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering or leaving.
Used in compression algorithms such as those used by the jpeg and mp3 file-formats.

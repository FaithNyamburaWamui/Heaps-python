Heaps.

Heaps  is a special  Tree-based Structure in which the tree is the complete  binary tree. The types of Heaps include max-Heaps and Min-Heaps.

Advantages of Heaps.

1) It helps in finding maximum and minimum elements.
2.) They do not have any limit on memory storage.
3.) Allows you to access variables globally.

Disadvantages of Heaps.

1.) It Takes longer to compute.
2.) Because it is used globally, memory management is more complicated.
3.) It takes longer to execute.

Properties of Heaps.

1.) It is a complete binary tree.
2.) Insertion and removal in heaps are efficient.
3.) The minimum and the maximum elements are always at the root of the heap.

Advantages of Heaps. 

1.) It is used in almost every 3D video to determine what object needs to be rendered.
2.) It is used in many search applications where data is constantly entering or leaving.
3.) It is used in compression algorithms such as those used by the jpeg and mp3 file formats.

# Heaps-python

Heaps.

Heaps  is a special  Tree-based Structure in which the tree is the complete  binary tree. The types of Heaps include max-Heaps and Min-Heaps.


Advantages of Heaps.


1) It helps in finding maximum and minimum elements.
   
2.) They do not have any limit on memory storage.

3.) Allows you to access variables globally.


Disadvantages of Heaps.


1.) It Takes longer to compute.

2.) Because it is used globally, memory management is more complicated.

3.) It takes longer to execute.


Properties of Heaps.


1.) It is a complete binary tree.

2.) Insertion and removal in heaps are efficient.

3.) The minimum and the maximum elements are always at the root of the heap.


Advantages of Heaps.


1.) It is used in almost every 3D video to determine what object needs to be rendered.

2.) It is used in many search applications where data is constantly entering or leaving.

3.) It is used in compression algorithms such as those used by the jpeg and mp3 file formats.



Tuples.


Tuples are ordered sets of values that store multiple data types. Tuples are immutable and are separated by commas. For instance, “(2.0, 3.4, 5.0)” is an example of a 3-tuple containing three numerical objects listed by commas inside the parenthesis.


Advantages of Tuples.


Immutable:  immutability ensures data integrity and prevents accidental changes.

Faster: Tuples are generally faster than lists because they have a smaller memory footprint and simpler internal structure.

Hashable: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries because they are hashable. This allows for efficient lookup and retrieval of data.

Safe: Since tuples are immutable, they can be used to store sensitive data that should not be modified.


Disadvantages of Tuples.


Limited Operations: Tuples have limited built-in operations compared to lists. For example, you cannot append, remove, or sort elements in a tuple.

Less Flexible: Tuples are less flexible than lists because they cannot be modified. If you need to change the elements, you have to create a new tuple.

Less Intuitive: Tuples can be less intuitive to work with, especially for beginners, due to their immutability and limited operations.


Properties of Tuples.


It can hold multiple values in a single variable.

It's ordered meaning that the item does not change.

A tuple can have duplicate values.

They are indexed you can access them numerically.
